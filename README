salty is an attempt to create  a simple, extendible vi-like web browser
library built on top of WebKit2GTK+ and written in Vala. An example
implementation is provided in GJS.

## State of the project
salty is a new project that hasn't hit any milestones so far. In other words:
nothing to see here, move along for now.

## Examples
In order to run the examples, you probably have to export the following
environment variables:

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.
	export GI_TYPELIB_PATH=.

Where . is the path to the directory where the library and typelib files are
located.

Or you can use example/run_local.sh from within the example directory.
